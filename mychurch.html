    <p>I currently attend my church called Nueva Esperanza. I have been attending this church for almost a year. However i have known this church for 5-6 years. I first heard about Nueva Esperanza when a child hood friend of mine that i grew up with at church invited me to go.
        Now that i am apart of this community i am beyond grateful and happy. You can find Nueva Esperanza on facebook, and instagram. Service is at 12:00-1:30 PMand if you would like to attend our youth group on friday 7:30-10:30 PM.
