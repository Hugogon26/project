The first church i attended was a church called Templo Getsemani and i was practically raised their. Ever since i have not looked back. I was 14 when i first got baptized and i have experienced the holy spirit. I've gotten to witness miracles and crazy things happen in my life and other peoples lives. I will always be grateful for my parents and the way they raised me into the right path.
